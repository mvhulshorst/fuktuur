<div class="example-wrapper">
    <h1>This is the homepage</h1>

    I have an idea on what to put here, except for the part that it sadly doesn't work yet:
    <ul>
        <li>I want to see the results of the combined tables here. How to do it? No idea yet.. I think I missed that lesson.</li>
        <li>I want to add a login system as well, possibly combined with a swiftmailer.</li>
        <li>I want to be able to use cart sessions.</li>
        <li>I want to be able to complete the PDF part of the assignment.</li>
        <li>And I want to upload this assignment to the internet.</li>
    </ul>
    Like I said already, I have no idea how to complete these things sadly. I've tried it on my own so far and I couldn't come with a solution yet.<br/>
    And I am aware this will get me in trouble later on. I need to keep going. And I need to ask help to do so. This is one of my ways to do so.
